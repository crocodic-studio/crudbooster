First of all, be sure you have published all assets from CB.  
After that, you should go to resources > views > vendor at you project directory.  
Over there, you will find two foldes : admin and login, each one with two blade templates :  
1. header.blade.php : You may add your own custom scripts to be located at `<header>` of default template
2. footer.blade.php : You may add your own scripts or html, css at the bottom of the default template `<body>`
