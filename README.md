## Using GitHub Issues Page

Do you have any doubt? Are you having some difficulty? Did you find a translation error, a bug, or any problem? Before posting, search on [CRUDBoster Issues](https://github.com/crocodic-studio/crudbooster/issues)  and make sure if anyone has not reported the same or similar problem.

To post you should detail the most about what happened. Specify in detail:

- Operating system (name, version and architecture)
- Web server (name, version and architecture)
- Browser (name, version and architecture)
- CRUDBooster version
- Laravel version
- What is the problem?
- How should it happen? What was the expected behavior?
- Tell how to reproduce the problem step by step
- If possible, take screenshots or send snippets of code

No one is obligated to understand you. Then explain your problem with clarity, detail and precision. Make yourself understandable. Once the problem is resolved, remember to thank those who helped and close the issue. 

If there is no interaction for a long period of time, it will be assumed that it has been resolved or that it is irrelevant, and may be closed without notice. Feel free to reopen it if you think it is really necessary.
