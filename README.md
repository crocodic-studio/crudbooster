Do you have any doubt? Are you having some difficulty? Did you find a translation error, a bug, or any problem? Before posting, search on [CRUDBoster Issues](https://github.com/crocodic-studio/crudbooster/issues)  and make sure if anyone has not reported the same or similar problem.

- Browser (name, version and architecture)
